# nominal:
#   1 = one feature is true and the other feature is not
#   0 = both features are true or not true

# metric:
#   d(x mj, x lj) = (| x mj - x lj |) / (max m mj - min m lj)

# ordinal:
#   need to be scaled to [0;1]
#   (i - 0.5)/ M   (M --> total number of features of m e.g. different lengths to highway from house 1,2,3,4,5 -> M = 5)
#   after being scaled ordinal variables will be measured like metric variables
