Validation information - short overview 
- validation is not the same as finding the optimal number of clusters it goes far more beyond  
- evaluating the perfomance of the clustering algorithims is more challenging than evaluatiuon supervised methods
because counting the errors is not possible (the true data is missing) 
- there is no right or wrong wihtin clustering evaluation - its more about the meaningfulness of a certain algorithim - expert knowledge needed 
-internal and external indexing possible 
- in general it s is more about interpreting and argueuing 

A.External 
1. Expert's opinion
2. External measures (ground truth is known )

B. Internal (Ground truth is unknown )
1. Silhouette Coefficient
