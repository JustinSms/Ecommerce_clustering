Validation information - short overview 
- validation is not the same as finding the optimal number of clusters it goes far more beyond  
- evaluating the perfomance of the clustering algorithims is more challenging than evaluatiuon supervised methods
beacasue counting the errors is not possible (the true data is missing) 
- there is no right or wrong wihtin clustering - its more about the meaningfulness of a certain algorithim - expert knowledge needded 
-internal and external indexing possible
